## Pizza Shop Story — High-Level System Design

You run a pizza shop. Business is booming, but now you need to **scale**.

### Scaling

You think:  
“How do I handle more orders?”

Well, I can **give more money to my chef**. He’ll buy better tools, work faster.  
	→ That’s **vertical scaling**.

But what if that’s not enough?

I’ll just **hire more chefs**!  
	→ That’s **horizontal scaling**.

Still not done? I’ll be smart and **make pizza bases during non-peak hours**, so during rush time, orders go faster.  
	→ That’s using **cron jobs to pre-process** tasks when load is low.

### Making it Resilient

Now the system is running great. But wait—  
**What if the chef falls ill?** Everything stops!  
→ That’s a **single point of failure**.

So I **hire a backup chef**, just in case.  
→ Now the system is **resilient**.

---

### Microservices

Later, you notice something else.

You’ve got **2 chefs great at making pizza**, and **1 chef awesome at bread**.  
So you think: “Why not **route orders based on expertise**?”

Pizza orders go to pizza chefs. Bread orders go to the bread chef.  
→ That’s **microservices architecture** — each person has a single responsibility.  
It’s efficient and **scales well**.

---

### Distributed Systems & Partitioning

One day, **a power outage hits** your main shop. Uh-oh!

But you're prepared.  
You open a **smaller backup outlet** with fewer chefs. It may be small, but it **keeps the orders flowing**.  
→ That’s a **distributed system with partitions** — no full blackout.

---

### Load Balancing

Now your business has **many outlets** across the city.

You assign someone at the front to **route each order** to the outlet that’s **closest to the customer** for faster delivery.  
→ That’s your **load balancer**.

---

### Decoupling

A customer calls and complains:  
“The **delivery guy** was rude.”

You don’t call the chef and yell at him, right?

Instead, you realize you need to **separate the delivery team from the kitchen team**.  
→ That’s called **decoupling** — systems handle their own responsibilities.

---

### The End

And that, my friend, is how your pizza shop turned into a **scalable, resilient, distributed, load-balanced, and decoupled system**.

That’s **High-Level System Design** — pizza style 🍕
